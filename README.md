Interview project

Design Choices:

- I transformed the initial product layout from cards to section rows with dropdown functionality. These rows display the most important information, and when selected, the dropdown reveals further details.
- I kept the style of the header, as it was already modern and required no changes.
- I added filters and sorting options in a sidebar within the main content section. The filters are based on meaningful product attributes, such as whether the skip is allowed on roads or if free shipping is available etc.
- I preserved the concept of the sticky footer that appears when a product is selected. However, it now disappears if you click "Select" on the already selected product.

Why I Believe This Is a Better Design:

- It serves customers info in a more streamlined way and makes the selection process easier to understand.
- Allows customers to filter skips based on their needs (this takes into consideration a possibly bigger given data set).

My shortcomings:

- I did not manage to make the design responsive within the given time.
- The color scheme could have been more cohesive; instead, I used multiple shades of my chosen colors.
- The lack of animations makes the page a little boring in my oppinion, I tried adding a hover annimation to the button but it is simplistic.
- Sorting section is a bit messy, the sort by hiring period is done in code as sorting the already sorted by size data using the hiring period as well.
- The sorting options are confusing. A checkbox is not ideal for sorting, since sorting typically requires three states: ascending, descending, and unsorted. Checkboxes only offer two options.
- I considered adding functional links to the header and footer, but time did not allow for it.

In hindsight:
Given more time, I could have created a better-looking and more functional page. Unfortunately, I did not anticipate receiving an email with a 72-hour deadline immediately after accepting the offer. A heads-up and a deadline for when to accept the offer would have been helpful, so participants can choose the right time to begin.

All in all, this coding challenge contributed to my learning journey, and Iâ€™m grateful for the experience.

Kind regards,
